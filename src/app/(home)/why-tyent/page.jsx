      description: `
        <div style="line-height: 1.6;">
         <p>
    When it comes to water ionization, one of the most crucial components is the plate design. The effectiveness of a water ionizer is largely determined by the quality, surface area, and strength of its plates. All Tyent Water Ionizers feature medical-grade Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate technology, offering the strength of solid plates and the extensive surface area of mesh designs. Our engineers designed Tyent plates to be the thickest, longest, and with more surface area in the industry, incorporating advanced electrolysis distribution for superior conductivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    While most ionizers use either solid or mesh plates, Tyent’s engineers found both designs lacking. Solid plates are strong but have poor electrical distribution, as electricity tends to flow around the outer edge like a lightning rod. Mesh plates provide more edges for better electrical distribution but are not durable enough to last.
  </p>

  <p>
    To overcome these limitations, Tyent developed the Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate, designed according to Faraday’s electrolysis principles. This unique plate combines the strength of solid plates with the superior conductivity of mesh design. Small holes are drilled into the solid plate to increase surface area for electrolysis, then the plate is dipped multiple times in platinum and baked for enhanced performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tyent’s Solid Hybrid Mesh Plates offer the best of both worlds: unmatched strength and exceptional electrolysis power. These plates will never break, crumble, or leach and are exclusive to Tyent water ionizers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plates are sourced from Permelac, a renowned Japanese company founded in 1969 and known for producing the industry's strongest plates. Tyent backs these plates with a 15-year warranty in India and a lifetime warranty in the USA. Made from titanium and coated with platinum, these plates undergo multiple dipping and baking processes for unmatched durability. Tyent is also the only ionizer brand that proudly discloses its plate manufacturer.

  <h3>Strength + Durability + More Surface Area + More Antioxidants = Solid Hybrid Mesh Plates</h3>

          <p>
          Plates are the core of a water ionizer, and the key factor is their surface area, not their height, width, or diameter. For instance, the size of a plate doesn’t directly impact the production of antioxidants. Some brands claim to have the largest plates, yet produce lesser antioxidants (-ORP). Tyent water ionizers utilize Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate technology, offering superior strength, durability and largest surface area in the industry, enabling higher antioxidant production and more accurate pH levels, delivering better overall performance.

           <h5>Three Types of Power Supplies Used in Water Ionizers</h5>

  <p>The following are the three types of power supplies used in water ionizers:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The older technology - Power Supply Unit's (PSU's) Transformer</li>
    <li>The power technology - Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS)</li>
    <li>The Patented technology - Patented SMPS PLUS Power supply</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Transformers</h2>
  <p>The older linear power supply units - known as PSUs with heavy transformers - are hefty and prone to overheating. Due to their simplicity, linear PSU’s do not allow for voltage adjustability. The technology behind linear PSU’s was developed in the early 1900’s. This ancient circuit design is less efficient than newer technology. However, some ionizer companies still use PSU’s simply because they are less expensive.</p>

  <h2>SMPS</h2>
  <p>SMPS's are an updated version of transformers. SMPS is the same technology used in flat-panel televisions, audio systems, laptops, computers, and other modern electronic devices. Compared to linear PSUs, SMPS units are lighter, smaller, and more efficient overall. SMPS also has a limitation to voltage adjustability.</p>

  <h2>SMPS PLUS</h2>
  <p>Tyent engineers wanted a better solution for our customers. They pooled their extensive knowledge and expertise and enhanced a traditional SMPS to work specifically in a water ionizer. The unit they created was named SMPS Plus. Tyent’s SMPS Plus gives you 55 adjustable power settings so you can create the perfect glass of alkaline water. The power and efficiency of SMPS Plus enables Tyent ionizer to create strong alkaline and acidic water without using chemicals from 11.5 pH to 2.5 pH.</p>

        <div style="line-height: 1.6;">
         <p>Ionized, hydrogen-rich alkaline water is highly beneficial, but its effectiveness depends on the purity of your drinking water. Tyent Water Ionizers feature two .01 micron filters, creating a multi-stage, customized system designed to remove impurities, bacteria, viruses, contaminants, and heavy metals from your tap water.
</p>
<p>
Our Tyent-filters use .01 micron filter media, similar to those used in kidney dialysis machines, and are the largest in the industry. The increased size of our filters ensures even greater water purity. Tyent water ionizers effectively eliminate contaminants, viruses, bacteria, and microorganisms.
</p>
<p>
As water passes lengthwise through the filters, the extended length provides more filtration media for the water to pass through, resulting in even purer water. Tyent stands as the industry leader in water filtration technology.

             <p>
            Tyent Water Ionizers use an automated Polarity Anti Scale Technology (PAST)- one of the most advanced cleaning systems in the industry. This automated cleaning cycle is triggered by both a timer and an internal sensor to ensure minimal mineral scale buildup on the electrodes for long-term performance. Better cleaning means longer-lasting components and healthier water.
